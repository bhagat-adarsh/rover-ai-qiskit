# üöÄ Mars Rover AI with Quantum-Inspired Action Selection

This project simulates a Mars rover learning to navigate a grid-like Martian terrain using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** and a **quantum-inspired action selection strategy** based on **Grover's algorithm** from Qiskit.

---

## üß† Key Features

- üîÅ **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Rover learns over episodes using a DQN.
- üßÆ **Quantum-Enhanced Decisions**: Action selection is guided by a simulated Grover search circuit to emphasize higher-value actions.
- üéÆ **Visualization**: Real-time display using Pygame to observe rover behavior.
- üåå **Goal**: Reach the target while avoiding obstacles in a grid environment.

## üìê Environment Details

- Grid Size: Configurable (default = 6√ó6)
- Rover starts at: `(0, 0)`
- Goal position: `(size-1, size-1)`
- Obstacles: 1 random obstacle placed each episode

### Rewards:
| Condition              | Reward   |
|------------------------|----------|
| Reaching Goal          | +10      |
| Stepping into Obstacle | -5       |
| Normal Step            | -0.1     |

## üß™ Quantum-Inspired Action Selection

The rover doesn't always pick the highest Q-value. Instead, it:
1. Simulates Grover‚Äôs algorithm using `qiskit`
2. Probabilistically biases toward the best actions
3. Adds an innovative twist to standard RL

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This uses Qiskit's **`BasicAer` simulator**, not a real quantum computer (but can be extended).
